# My dotfiles

This is the system configuration that I use on my Arch Linux computers.

There's a script which installs most required things automatically.

These things need to be installed manually:
- the Kvantum theme. Obtained from https://github.com/dracula/gtk/tree/master/kde/kvantum/Dracula-Solid

## Other configuration
This section documents some settings which aren't in this repo.
- Firefox about:config
    - browser.display.auto_quality_min_font_size = 10

## TODO
- package mabi-shell properly
